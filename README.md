# Bayesian NLP

To test the DP of Collins & Duffy (2001), I implemented a parse tree generator, which creates a grammar from a corpus and then generates random sentences (and consequently parse trees). Thus, the testing does not rely on hand-constructed examples anymore.

Required libraries:
NLTK - can be installed via pip
cfgen - https://github.com/williamgilpin/cfgen (incl. pyStatparser)
